## üìù Description

This is a command-line interface (CLI) tool designed to fetch academic paper information from PubMed, specifically filtering for articles that may have non-academic authors based on their affiliation details. It helps researchers and analysts identify publications potentially influenced by industry or private entities.

## ‚ú® Features

* **PubMed Integration**: Fetches paper IDs and detailed XML data directly from the PubMed E-utilities API.
* **Affiliation Parsing**: Extracts article titles, authors, PMIDs, and their affiliations from complex PubMed XML responses.
* **Non-Academic Filtering**: Identifies authors from non-academic institutions (e.g., companies, pharmaceutical industries, private entities) based on a configurable keyword list.
* **CSV Output**: Saves filtered paper details (PMID, Title, Authors, Affiliations) into a structured CSV file for easy analysis.
* **Python Poetry Setup**: Manages project dependencies and virtual environments using Poetry for a clean development workflow.
